## How to use

### Method 1 - Manual install

   Quick install without reboot needed:
   ```sh
   wget -O /boot/extra/{{PKG_FILE}} {{REPO_URL}}/slackware/{{PKG_FILE}} && installpkg /boot/extra/{{PKG_FILE}}
   ```
2. Run `fish` command in console.
3. Enjoy.

### Method 2 - Install and keep updated via [un-get](https://github.com/ich777/un-get)

1. Manually install the un-get plugin from your server's `Plugins` -> `Install Plugin` tab using this URL:

   ```text
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ich777/un-get/master/un-get.plg
   ```

2. ```sh
   # Add this repo as a source to un-get
   echo "{{REPO_URL}}/slackware/ unraid-fish-shell" >> /boot/config/plugins/un-get/sources.list

   # Update un-get sources
   un-get update

   # Install fish
   un-get install fish

   # Upgrade fish in the future
   un-get update && un-get upgrade fish
   ```

### Optional: Change the default shell to fish

Run `chsh -s "$(which fish)"` to change the default shell to fish. Add the command to `/boot/config/go` to change it on boot.
